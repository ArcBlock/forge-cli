## How to debug when `forge start` failed?

When `forge start` exits without printing the forge daemon process list, it's very likely that `forge` can not be started on your environment. To get an idea of what's wrong, please run `forge start --dry-run`, then you will get the command to diagnose forge start errors, **similiar to but not the same** as following:

```shell
ERL_AFLAGS="-sname forge-main-22d6998e70d5750c6c014292b648eea5" FORGE_CONFIG=/Users/zhenqiang/.forge_chains/forge_arcblock/forge_release.toml /Users/zhenqiang/.forge_cli/release/forge/0.36.1/bin/forge start
```

Run the command, and create an issue for us at [https://github.com/ArcBlock/forge-cli/issues](https://github.com/ArcBlock/forge-cli/issues), we will investigate as soon as possible.

## How to start forge with custom config or release directory?

Developer can provide different forge config file path and forge release directory at will.

- forge config file path can be provided with `$FORGE_CONFIG`, or `--config-path`
- forge release dir can be provided with `$FORGE_RELEASE_DIR`, or `--release-dir`

And these 2 options can be combined to meet any developer needs to start forge with different config or release.

Here is my configuration to test latest forge master:

```shell
export FORGE_RELEASE_DIR=$HOME/Develop/arcblock/forge/_build/staging/rel
```

When I test with latest forge release:

```shell
export FORGE_RELEASE_DIR=$HOME/.forge_cli/release
```

When I need to start forge with simple custom config:

```shell
export FORGE_CONFIG=/PATH_TO/examples/simple/forge.toml
```

When I need to start forge with nodejs kvstore example config:

```shell
export FORGE_CONFIG=/PATH_TO/examples/kvstore/config/forge.toml
```
